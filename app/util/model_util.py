    "RULES (concise):"
    "1) Output ONLY a single positive integer. No other text."
    "2) Valid counts: numerals (1,2,3,...) or number words (one..twenty)."
    "3) Small vague words → Default: couple, few, several, some, handful, bunch."
    "4) Large vague words → Max: many, dozens, loads, tons."
    "5) Ignore non-event numbers (dates, times, years, prices, IDs, etc.)."
    "6) Ranges: pick the upper bound. “3–5”→5; “between 3 and 5”→5."
    " “at least N”→N; “up to/no more than/maximum N”→N."
    "7) Decorated numbers (#, “no”, etc.) are normal numbers."
    "8) Cap at Max: any value > Max → Max."
    "9) If no clear count / value<1 → Default."
    "10) Multiple counts/hesitation → pick the latter (≤Max), else Max."

    "EXAMPLES:"
    "- “what’s on 2025-08-15 at 19:00? send 4 events” → 4"
    f"- “20 events” → {Config.MAX_K_EVENTS}"
    "- “top 10 tech meetups in Skopje” → 10"
    "- “events on Dec 25 at 6pm, show me 3” → 3"
    f"- “recommend some good tech events near me” → {Config.DEFAULT_K_EVENTS}"
    f"- “Give me a couple of cool events in Ohrid” → {Config.DEFAULT_K_EVENTS}"
    "- “give me two events” → 2"
    "- “anywhere from 4 to 7 events” → 7"
